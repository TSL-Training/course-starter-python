# Using objects in functions

In any Python program we will have some data and some objective to achieve - something to do with that data. Python provides many data types and many ways of working with that data. 

Manipulating data is done with functions. Data is stored in objects. In this section we'll look at functions and objects and their interaction.

Let's see the simplest example of this workflow, let's take a string (a text carrying object) and use it in a function.


```python
# Print something
print("Hello, world!")
```

```out
Hello, world!
```

In this example the string `"Hello, World!"`, is being given to the `print()` function. Functions are bits of code that do stuff to data. The `print()` function just prints the data that you pass it to the screen. We pass data to functions by putting the data in the brackets after the function name. 


Notes: Data is a very big word in programming, it carries a lot of meaning. It can mean very small bits of stuff, like a single text character, or huge amounts of stuff, like the images collected by the Hubble telescope. It's all the same to the computer and programming language. Here our "data" is the text "Hello, world!". Data is stored in things we generically call objects. You will see many different types of object, each is a container for different types of data.
